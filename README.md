Skinmenu
========

Skin your HTML selects with more functionality and personality.

NOTE: This plug-in is in development and should not be used in public project releases.


Skinmenu is a jQuery plug-in created for the purpose of skinning select elements with custom themes with minimal setup and options. Also, this plug-in provides support for dynamically modified selects (updating a select element will automatically update the skinned menu).

The dynamic select support is a feature I found missing in many jQuery plug-ins and it is this feature that made me start writing my own.
